# SYNOPSIS
Hypercore is a secure, distributed append-only log.

# OBJECTIVES
- `datcxx` should ultimately output Static and Dynamic shared Libraries (so the
internal structure of this project won't matter to the end consumer).

- You should be able to do something like `[brew|apt] install libdat` and then
`#include <libdat>` and use it like it was any other C++ library.

- It will have a public interface that is at parity with other implementations
(the JavaScript implementation being today's canonical implementation).

# BUILD
To generate a `shared library`, install the [`build`][0] tool and run the
